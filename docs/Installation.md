## Here we will go over the steps needed to install R and RStudio

### What is R?
R is a free to download and use open-source computer language developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in 1993. It is an updated version of its predecessor the S programming language, which was commonly utilised in the early 1980s for statistical programming. R is designed to process and analyze complex statistical computations, store analysis and display results using complex visual graphics. R works in a sandbox known as the "environment"  which is a collection of objects such as variables, functions, tables etc. The underlying coding architecture of R is written in C, Fortran, and R itself. Complex workflows of functions are stored in the form of "packages" which can be installed in R and used to execute a series of tasks on a dataset. These packages are written in R however they may rely on C, C++, python and Fortran. R's computational philisophy is centered on object oreinted programming (OOP).
