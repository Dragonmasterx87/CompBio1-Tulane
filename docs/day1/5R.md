## Here we will go over a basic introduction to R

### What is R?
R is a free to download and use open-source computer language developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in 1993. It is an updated version of its predecessor the S programming language, which was commonly utilised in the early 1980s for statistical programming. R is designed to process and analyze complex statistical computations, store analysis and display results using complex visual graphics. R works in a sandbox known as the "environment"  which is a collection of objects such as variables, functions, tables etc. The underlying coding architecture of R is written in C, Fortran, and R itself. Complex workflows of functions are stored in the form of "packages" which can be installed in R and used to execute a series of tasks on a dataset. These packages are written in R however they may rely on C, C++, python and Fortran. R's computational philisophy is centered on object oriented programming (OOP).

### Lets install R
In order to install R navigate to the R download page. R is a free to download and use statistical software, unlike many of the softwares out there, it is totally free for the entire community! Anyone can use R.
In order to download R go here: [R Download Page](https://www.r-project.org/). Here a page like this will open up:

Now click on the link that says **download R** which will take you to the following page:

This page is the The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) mirror page which allows you to specify which country's mirror you will use to download R. R is stored in multiple redundant servers across the world.
Once you have clicked on the highlighted link you will now go to the following page:

From here click on the download link that matches with your operating system (OS) for example I am using Ubuntu/Windows so I will click on either **Download R for Linux (Debian, Fedora/Redhat, Ubuntu)** or **Download R for Windows** depending on the OS I am using. The next page will take you to a donwload page, you want to install R in its basic form so click on  **install R for the first time**. Once you have downloaded the installer, proceed to complete the installation process by accepting default settings. You have now installed R, however R in its basic form is not productive to use and opens as a basic console:

The console is called a GUI or [Gaphical User Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface), however a more interactive method of using R is via an [Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)
