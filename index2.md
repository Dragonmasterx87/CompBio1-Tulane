Welcome to the Computational Biology 1 Workshop (CB1W)!

In this workshop attendees will learn how to utilize the Seurat package in R to analyze single cell RNA sequenceing data.

# Learning Outline:
## Day 1
1. Introduction to single cell RNA sequencing
2. Experimental design
3. Comparison of library preparation and sequencing platforms
4. Overview of single-cell analysis using Seurat
5. Installing R and basic syntax
 
## Day 2:
1. Data loading/QC/filtering
2. Normalization using VST and SC Transform
3. Multidimensional reduction and cell clustering
4. Differential testing framework
5. Visualization
6. Pitfalls, caveats, and future topics



If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^1] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

[Browse our documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.

To get started with creating a site, just click "[use this template]"!

If you want to maintain your docs in the `docs` directory of an existing project repo, see [Hosting your docs from an existing project repo](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template/blob/main/README.md#hosting-your-docs-from-an-existing-project-repo) in the template README.
